### Development Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, JSON, PhoneGap.


### Note on Usage

Troubleshooting: The app will only work correctly when uploaded on a running server 
(e.g. apache, app engine, etc.). The reason is the CORS request won't work otherwise. 
And the CORS request is essential to fetch and use the .json files which this app uses.
